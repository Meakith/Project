    <h1>Battle Of Grunwald</h1>
    <section>

        <p id="first">The Battle of Grunwald, Battle of Žalgiris or First Battle of Tannenberg was fought on 15 July
            1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The alliance of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the
            Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), who did not participate
            in the battle himself, and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German Teutonic Order, led by Grand
            Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Order's leadership were killed or taken prisoner.

            Although defeated, the Teutonic Order withstood the subsequent siege of the Malbork Castle and suffered
            minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn (1411), with other territorial disputes continuing until
            the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The order, however, never recovered their former power, and the financial
            burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands controlled by
            them. The battle shifted the balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the
            Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant regional political and military force.[8]

            The battle was one of the largest in medieval Europe.[9] The battle is viewed as one of the most important
            victories in the histories of Poland and Lithuania. It is also commemorated in Ukraine and Belarus. It has
            been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride, becoming a larger symbol of struggle against
            foreign invaders.[10] During the 20th century, the battle was used in Nazi German and Soviet propaganda
            campaigns. Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the
            battle, reconciling the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.</p>

        <p id="first">Here are few contemporary, reliable sources about the battle, and most were produced by the Polish
            side. The most important and trustworthy source is Cronica conflictus Wladislai regis Poloniae cum
            Cruciferis anno Christi 1410, which was written within a year of the battle by an eyewitness.[12] Its
            authorship is uncertain, but several candidates have been proposed: Polish deputy chancellor Mikołaj Trąba
            and Władysław II Jagiełło's secretary Zbigniew Oleśnicki.[16] While the original Cronica conflictus did not
            survive, a short summary from the 16th century has been preserved. Another important source is Historiae
            Polonicae by Polish historian Jan Długosz (1415–1480).[16] It is a comprehensive and detailed account
            written several decades after the battle. The reliability of this source suffers not only from the long gap
            between the events and the chronicle, but also Długosz's alleged biases against the Lithuanians.[17]
            Banderia Prutenorum is a mid-15th-century manuscript with images and Latin descriptions of the Teutonic
            battle flags captured during the battle and displayed in Wawel Cathedral and Vilnius Cathedral.[18] Other
            Polish sources include two letters written by Władysław II Jagiełło to his wife Anne of Cilli and Bishop of
            Poznań Wojciech Jastrzębiec and letters sent by Jastrzębiec to Poles in the Holy See.[17] German sources
            include a concise account in the chronicle of Johann von Posilge. An anonymous letter, discovered in 1963
            and written between 1411 and 1413, provided important details on Lithuanian maneuvers.</p>
